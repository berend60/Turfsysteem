# Turfsysteem
A program used to keep track of inventory and who consumes what in our house. Used in combination
with a touch screen monitor for private use.
## Why I made this
I currently live in a house with ten other guys. We have a common inventory
with consumables such as beer, soda, etc. Keeping track of who consumes what was
done with pen and paper for decades. Converting this into everyones balance was
very tedious and it was easy to make mistakes. This digital program makes it a lot easier
to keep track of our inventory!
